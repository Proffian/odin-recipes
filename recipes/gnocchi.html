    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <ul class="myUL">
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Gnocchi</li>
            <li>Vegetables</li>
            <li>Cream sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol class="myOL">
            <li>Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Slice chicken breasts in half horizontally to create thin breasts. Sprinkle with seasonings.</li>
            <li>Place chicken in the skillet and cook until golden brown on each side, about 4 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and keep warm.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, melt butter. Add gnocchi and season with salt and pepper. Cook until gnocchi is golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove gnocchi to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Add broccoli, zucchini, squash, mushrooms, and bell pepper and season with Italian seasoning. Saute until vegetables are crisp and tender, 5 to 7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the vegetables. Add minced garlic during the last 45 seconds; quickly saute until fragrant. Remove vegetables to the same bowl with gnocchi.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the same skillet; and cook shallot until softened and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, half-and-half, and heavy cream. Whisk in flour, and cook, whisking to prevent lumps, until thickened, about 3 minutes. Squeeze in lemon juice to taste.</li>
            <li>Combine gnocchi and vegetables with cream sauce, and top with cooked chicken.</li>
